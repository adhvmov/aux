                    A heat pump uses as much as 75% of free energy available in the air and electricity makes up for 25%. Actually, it means that the device collects heat that is present in the air and transfers is to the building consuming a small amount of electricity. Energy efficiency of a heat is determined by the coefficient of performance (COP) which determines ratio of the amount of heat supplied to the amount of electricity consumed. The higher the COP, the greater the energy efficiency. The higher the energy efficiency indicator, the higher the efficiency and consequently – the savings. A heat pump is one of the most economical and environmentally friendly heating systems.

                <h3>HOW DOES A HEAT PUMP WORK?</h3>
                <p>                                 
                    The vast majority of air-to-water heat pumps are classified as renewable energy sources and are currently considered the most efficient heating solution. An air-to-water heat pump is a device that uses heat accumulated in the air for heating or cooling space and for domestic hot water system. Against all appearances, the way a heat pump works is not complicated and it uses a well-known mechanism that can be found in refrigerators for example. The most important parts of a heat pump are: the compressor, expansion valve, condenser and evaporator. The whole process is possible thanks to physical properties of refrigerant. Refrigerant is a liquid that circulates in the close loop system. It boils at low pressure and low temperature and this way it absorbs heat from the environment. Then pressure and temperature are increased in the system by a compressor and the refrigerant changes into gas and next it moves to a condenser and releases heat to the system. Afterwards liquid refrigerant passes through the expansion valve where the pressure and temperature drop and the process starts again. If a heat pump provides cooling, the process is reversed – refrigerant absorbs heat from water and removes it outside.

                    Coefficient of performance, which determines the ratio of the amount of thermal energy supplied to the heat pump to the amount of energy consumed by it. If the COP of a heat pump is 5, it means that the device consumes 1kW of electricity to provide 5kW of heat

                    Air-to-water heat pumps work with the following heat receivers: fan coil units, radiators or floor heating system. However, the use of low-temperature heat receivers works best in terms of efficiency. Radiant heating is characterized by large surface and as a consequence there is no need for high temperature in the system contrary to compact heat sources.                </p>
